## DB setup:

1. Make sure user and database exist

## Annotation process

user1,user2 etc should be appended to the url like this: `http://localhost:8080/?session=user1`


## TODOs:
1. Make it possible to pass `.env` or `.env.local` as an argument to Dockerfile such that scripts/mkconfig.py gets to know which `.env` to file to work with
